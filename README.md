# 🧮 Codeforces A: Numbers – Aqua Neuron 2023 << AI Sprints >>

This repository contains my **first solved Codeforces problem**, completed with the help of AI during **Aqua Neuron 2023 <<AI Sprints>>**.  
The problem statement is from **Codeforces**: [**A. Numbers**](https://codeforces.com/gym/470049/problem/A).

---

## 📖 Problem Statement
Valera needs to count numbers in an interval `[a, b]` whose **smallest divisor greater than 1** is exactly `k`.  

Formally:
- Count numbers divisible by `k`.
- Ensure they are **not divisible** by any number from `2` to `k-1`.  

**Constraints:**

1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2×10⁹

2 ≤ k ≤ 2×10⁹

## ✅ Examples

| Input        | Output |
|---------------|--------|
| `1 10 2`      | `5`    |
| `12 23 3`     | `2`    |
| `6 19 5`      | `0`    |
